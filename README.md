## Meeting Notes – Coffee Analysis Training Session

### 1st Meeting

#### **Client’s Aim**
The client’s goal is to sell high-quality coffee beans and establish a strong market presence in Southampton. Using the dataset, the objectives are:

- Identify which country produces the most suitable coffee beans for the client.
- Provide clear evidence supporting the recommendation (e.g., flavour profile, rating).
- Determine the client’s preference between washed and wet processing methods.
- Assess which coffee origins are best suited for black coffee drinkers.

#### **Summary of Client Requirements**
1. **Q1:** How to define the criteria for “good coffee”?  
   **A1:** Based on good flavour and high ratings in the dataset.  
2. **Q2:** Who are the customers?  
   **A2:** Office workers who prefer black coffee and the best quality beans.  
3. **Q3:** Clarify preference between washed and wet processing methods.  
4. **Q4:** Visualisation preferences – start with single-type data visualisation first.  

#### **Discussion Summary**
- Use dataset evidence (flavour scores, ratings, processing types) to support recommendations.
- Begin with clear, single-variable visualisations before moving to more complex comparisons.
