## Meeting Notes – Coffee Analysis Training Session

### 1st Meeting

#### **Client’s Aim**

The client’s goal is to sell high-quality coffee beans and establish a strong market presence in Southampton. Using the dataset, the objectives are:

* Identify which country produces the most suitable coffee beans for the client.
* Provide clear evidence supporting the recommendation (e.g., flavour profile, rating).
* Determine the client’s preference between washed and wet processing methods.
* Assess which coffee origins are best suited for black coffee drinkers.

#### **Summary of Client Requirements**

1. **Q1:** How to define the criteria for “good coffee”?  
   **A1:** Based on good flavour and high ratings in the dataset.
2. **Q2:** Who are the customers?  
   **A2:** Office workers who prefer black coffee and the best quality beans.
3. **Q3:** Clarify preference between washed and wet processing methods.
4. **Q4:** Visualisation preferences – start with single-type data visualisation first.

#### **Discussion Summary**

* Use dataset evidence (flavour scores, ratings, processing types) to support recommendations.
* Begin with clear, single-variable visualisations before moving to more complex comparisons.
